\exercise{3.3}
Discussed in person.

\exercise{3.9}
Check that $\Free(G)$ is a category for any graph $G$.

\solution
It is clear that concatenating any path with the trivial path yields the original, so unitality is satisfied.  Concatenation of paths is also associative (you can think of paths as lists of vertices/edges, which makes this clear).

Discussed in person

\exercise{3.12}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the category $\textbf{1}$?
	\item What is the category $\textbf{0}$?
	\item What is the formula for the number of morphisms in $\textbf{n}$ for arbitrary $n\in\N$?
\end{enumerate}

\solution
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\textbf{1}$ has a single object and only the identity morphism; it corresponds to the free category on the graph with one vertex.
	\item $\textbf{0}$ has no objects and no morphisms.
	\item The number of morphisms is $\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.  This is because there is one path of length $n-1$, two of length $n-2$, and so on until you get $n$ paths of length 1.
\end{enumerate}

\exercise{3.15}
In the loop graph, we identified paths with numbers $n\in\N$.  Given $m,n\in\N$, what number corresponds to the concatenation of their associated paths?

\solution
The concatenation corresponds to $m+n$.

\exercise{3.22}
What is the preorder reflection of the category $\N$?

\exercise{3.25}
Let $\underline{2}=\{1,2\}$ and $\underline{3}=\{1,2,3\}$.  Write down all nine elements of $\Set(\underline{2},\underline{3})$.

\exercise{3.30}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the inverse $f^{-1}:\underline{3}\to A$ of the function $f$ given in Example 3.29?
	\item How many distinct isomorphism are there $A\to\underline{3}$?
\end{enumerate}

\exercise{3.31}
Show that in any category $\mcC$, for any given object $c\in\mcC$, the identity $\id_c$ is an isomorphism.

\exercise{3.32}
A monoid in which every morphism is an isomorphism is a group.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Is the monoid in Example 3.13 a group?
	\item Is the monoid in Example 3.18 a group?
\end{enumerate}

\exercise{3.33}
Let $G$ be a graph and $\Free(G)$ the corresponding free category.  Is it true that the only isomorphism in $\Free(G)$ are the identity morphisms?
